A platform to optimise agricultural supply chain to minimise wastage and improve food security.

### Problem

India, with its diverse agricultural landscape, faces a significant challenge in mitigating post-harvest losses, leading to substantial crop wastage. One of the primary contributors to this issue is the inefficient management of the agricultural supply chain. The current system involves farmers, cold storage facilities, distributors, and consumers, but lacks a cohesive and streamlined approach. As a result, precious agricultural produce is lost at various stages, leading to economic losses for farmers and impacting food security on a national scale.

### How agrosafe aims to solve it

Agrosafe is a solution addressing the challenges of fragmented agricultural supply chain by providing a comprehensive platform for farmers, distributors and storage owners. The platform allows farmers to list their surplus, owner's their lot of storage and allows distributors to seamlessly connect them and ship crops that would rather go to waste. It also provides storage owners with facilities to monitor temperature, humidity and other necessary parameters of the storage units via installation of economical sensor modules implemented using Arduino.  Leveraging map APIs, our platform enables seamless connectivity, empowering stakeholders to list their locations, surplus produce, and available storage lots. This innovative approach enhances communication, streamlines logistics, and fosters collaboration across the agricultural ecosystem.
